## Creating React App

Create a TS React app â€” Do not make any changes.

Commit as the initial commit and push.

Add Prettier and make sure it runs locally on file save

Add ESLint and also make sure it runs on file save.

Push ESLint as an individual PR and Prettier as an individual PR - Request my review.

I like StyledComponents and we should try to use them if we can here too. 

Review the default creations from the initial commit and make a PR deleting the default things (such as the React logo and basic homepage)

Finally, a PR to Create a basic home page.

We should do this all branched off of a development branch, and do not merge to main. Main will keep in sync with development every now and again when we ensure nothing is broken before pushing to main.

Ensure we have jest for automated testing.
